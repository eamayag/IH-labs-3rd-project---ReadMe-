## READ ME!: What if a tag could save your life? 

A simple way of having a helpful assistance in case of emergency.
Designed for cases when an emergency response is needed, but no info is available. 
This is an interactive web via NFC-tags (just as proximity cards). 
It allows to know more about the person who's wearing the NFC tag, so assistance can be
provided until an ambulance, an emergency contact or police attends. 
Typical profiles for this need:
1. Alzheimer and dementia senile patients.
2. Specifically conditions that could need inmediate assistance: heart problems, hypoglycemia, diabetes...

With this device they can wear always a helpful information for the person who's trying to give assistance. 
You'll now what he/she specifically needs, problems he/she could have, who to call, and what to do meanwhile.

## NFC use: 

NFC works just by proximity; if your mobile have NFC you must activate it, and just approach the phone to
the tag. The phone will open the browser with the info.

**Android use to have NFC reader by default.**

**iPhones usually need to download a NFC reader app ([example here](https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/nfc-reader-scanner/id1282502362?mt=8))**
